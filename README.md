Hi

I’m a freelance software engineer passionate about turning complex ideas into **elegant**, **reliable systems**. I specialize in **fullstack development**, **blockchain applications**, and building tools that make developers’ lives easier.

Beyond coding, I enjoy designing decentralized systems, exploring cutting-edge Rust and Python projects, and helping clients architect solutions that scale and adapt to real-world challenges.

When I step away from the keyboard, you’ll find me cycling through gravel trails, diving into progressive metal riffs, or experimenting with home automation and self-hosted services, always curious about how technology can enhance life without taking over it.
